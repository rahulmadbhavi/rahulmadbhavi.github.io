    summary: |
      I conducted my doctoral research at <b>IIT Madras</b>, specializing in <b>Advanced Estimation Strategies for Sparsely Observed Cyber-Physical Systems</b>.
      I pioneered the development of <b>low-rank tensor completion frameworks</b> and <b>Graph Neural Network (GNN) equivalents</b> to enable high-fidelity situational awareness in smart grids and water distribution networks, even under extreme conditions of <b>low-observability</b> and <b>data scarcity</b>.
      <br><br>
      My research introduced <b>feature scaling</b> and <b>weighted tensor norms</b> to optimize state estimation accuracy across diverse physical quantities, significantly <b>reducing errors in voltage angle and magnitude estimation</b>.
      By architecting GNN-based estimators that learn system interdependencies without requiring prior knowledge of network parameters, I achieved <b>computational speedups of several orders of magnitude</b> while ensuring <b>strict conformance with physical power flow constraints</b>.
      Furthermore, I extended these methodologies to solve critical infrastructure challenges, including <b>topology identification</b> via link prediction and <b>machine-learning-based leak localization</b> in water distribution networks.

    summary: |
      I completed my Bachelor of Technology in <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> at the <b>National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), Surathkal</b>.
      My final year project focused on the <b>semi-active vibration control of a sandwich beam</b> with a <b>Magnetorheological Elastomer (MRE)</b> core.
      I led the <b>design</b>, <b>fabrication</b>, and <b>experimental characterization</b> of these adaptive structures, which utilize smart materials to enable real-time tuning of structural stiffness and damping properties.
      <br><br>
      During this project, I developed <b>system models</b> to predict the dynamic response of composite beams under varying magnetic field intensities.
      I conducted <b>experimental validation using LabVIEW-integrated data acquisition</b>, demonstrating that the system’s <b>natural frequencies</b> could be actively shifted.
      This work provided a viable solution for tunable vibration isolation, offering significant applications in aerospace and high-precision mechanical systems.

      I served as a <b>Visiting Scholar</b> at <b>Kansas State University</b>, where I collaborated with <b>Dr. Balasubramaniam Natarajan</b> to advance the mathematical foundations of situational awareness in power distribution grids.
      My research during this period focused on developing <b>sparsity-aware state estimation frameworks</b>, specifically pioneering <b>tensor completion-based approaches</b> to address the challenges of <b>low-observability and missing data</b> in modernized grids.
      <br><br>
      This collaboration resulted in <b>high-impact publications</b> in <b>IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</b> and presentations at <b>2020 IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference (ISGT)</b>, where we demonstrated that leveraging the underlying multi-dimensional structure of grid data significantly improves voltage estimation accuracy.
      By integrating advanced mathematical frameworks with models from power systems engineering, I developed robust methodologies that ensure system awareness despite limited sensor coverage.
      This role was instrumental in bridging the gap between theoretical network science and the practical engineering constraints of interdependent infrastructure.
