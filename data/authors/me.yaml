    summary: |
      I conducted my doctoral research at IIT Madras, specializing in Advanced Estimation Strategies for Sparsely Observed Cyber-Physical Systems.
      I pioneered the development of low-rank tensor completion frameworks and Graph Neural Network (GNN) equivalents to enable high-fidelity situational awareness in smart grids and water distribution networks, even under extreme conditions of low-observability and data scarcity.
      <br>
      My research introduced feature scaling and weighted tensor norms to optimize state estimation accuracy across diverse physical quantities, significantly reducing errors in voltage angle and magnitude estimation.
      By architecting GNN-based estimators that learn system interdependencies without requiring prior knowledge of network parameters, I achieved computational speedups of several orders of magnitude while ensuring strict conformance with physical power flow constraints.
      Furthermore, I extended these methodologies to solve critical infrastructure challenges, including topology identification via link prediction and machine-learning-based leak localization in water distribution networks.
