    summary: |
      I conducted my doctoral research at <b>IIT Madras</b>, specializing in <b>Advanced Estimation Strategies for Sparsely Observed Cyber-Physical Systems</b>.
      I pioneered the development of <b>low-rank tensor completion frameworks</b> and <b>Graph Neural Network (GNN) equivalents</b> to enable high-fidelity situational awareness in smart grids and water distribution networks, even under extreme conditions of <b>low-observability</b> and <b>data scarcity</b>.
      <br><br>
      My research introduced <b>feature scaling</b> and <b>weighted tensor norms</b> to optimize state estimation accuracy across diverse physical quantities, significantly <b>reducing errors in voltage angle and magnitude estimation</b>.
      By architecting GNN-based estimators that learn system interdependencies without requiring prior knowledge of network parameters, I achieved <b>computational speedups of several orders of magnitude</b> while ensuring <b>strict conformance with physical power flow constraints</b>.
      Furthermore, I extended these methodologies to solve critical infrastructure challenges, including <b>topology identification</b> via link prediction and <b>machine-learning-based leak localization</b> in water distribution networks.

    summary: |
      I completed my Bachelor of Technology in <b>Mechanical Engineering</b> at the <b>National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), Surathkal</b>.
      My final year project focused on the <b>semi-active vibration control of a sandwich beam</b> with a <b>Magnetorheological Elastomer (MRE)</b> core.
      I led the <b>design</b>, <b>fabrication</b>, and <b>experimental characterization</b> of these adaptive structures, which utilize smart materials to enable real-time tuning of structural stiffness and damping properties.
      <br><br>
      During this project, I developed <b>system models</b> to predict the dynamic response of composite beams under varying magnetic field intensities.
      I conducted <b>experimental validation using LabVIEW-integrated data acquisition</b>, demonstrating that the system’s <b>natural frequencies</b> could be actively shifted.
      This work provided a viable solution for tunable vibration isolation, offering significant applications in aerospace and high-precision mechanical systems.
